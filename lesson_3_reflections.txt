When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all

A remote repository would be beneficial when multiple people are

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If multiple people are working on the same file, automatic pulling will 
create multiple versions of the same file, or may replace your file in 
your local repository, which you may want to avoid.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
